# styled-next
Just styled components added to Next.JS :)
It's the companion repo for the [Styled - NextJS lesson on Egghead](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-add-styled-components-to-a-next-js-project/).

For reference, please see Styled Components' [guide to SSR](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#server-side-rendering), and the Next.JS [sample repository for Styled Components](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-styled-components).
